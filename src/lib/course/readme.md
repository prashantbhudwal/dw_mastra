# Video Guidelines

- Duration
  - Max duration: 6 mins
  - Median duration:3.5 mins
- Types
  - Foundations
    - These videos are independent of the topic of the course.
    - These videos don't die when the Mastra API changes or Mastra stops existing
    - In this case it may include videos on
      - Vector databases
      - Agents
      - Tools
      - Embeddings
    - These videos will have no mention about being part of the course.
    - There will be no way to connect these videos to the course, other than their metadata
  - Code 
    - These will be video 

# Workflow

- study the mastra module
- code the module
- split modules into videos
  - studying a topic generates goals
  - goals generate videos
- record one video at a time
- edit one module at a time

# Editing workflow

1. Record the video with tella
2. Apply auto zoom
3. Edit the transcript
4. Finetune Edits manually
5. Hide subtitles
6. Download
7. Remove noise with iMovie
8. Generate a thumbnail
9. Upload to youtube

# Days

- Day 1: Study and code a module, generate goals at the end of the day
- Day 2: Write code for end state of each video
- Day 3: Record 1-3 videos
- Day 4: Record 1-3 videos
- Day 5: Edit the module & generate thumbnails
- Day 6: Buffer, Publish the module

# Estimates

- The course will have around 30 short videos of 3-5 mins each
- That means 5-6 modules
- That means 30-36 days
- That means 2 months if done on alternate weeks

# First week Target

- Produce and publish on module
- Revise the estimates after week one

# Recording guidelines

1. Start sentences after a pause. Pauses can be removed later.
2. When repeating
   1. Repeat the whole last sentence
   2. Pause before repeating

## Attempt 1

- The voice was a bit low.
